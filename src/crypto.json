      "description": "\tIn cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\tThe encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security."

      "description": "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.\n\tFor example, if the plaintext is attacking tonight and the key is OCULORHINOLARINGOLOGY, then\n\n▶️ the first letter a of the plaintext is shifted by 14 positions in the alphabet (because the first letter O of the key is the 14th letter of the alphabet, counting from 0), yielding o;\n▶️ the second letter t is shifted by 2 (because the second letter C of the key means 2) yielding v;\n▶️ the third letter t is shifted by 20 (U) yielding n, with wrap-around;\n\nand so on; yielding the message ovnlqbpvt hznzouz. If the recipient of the message knows the key, they can recover the plaintext by reversing this process.\n\tThe Vigenère cipher is therefore a special case of a polyalphabetic substitution. First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description le chiffrage indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.\n\tIn the 19th century, the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523-1596) and so acquired its present name."
